Building and Deploying a Full-Stack Microservices Application on Minikube

Objective:
Develop a full-stack microservices application with a frontend, backend, and database,
including user authentication features (Login, Signup, and Forgot Password). Containerize
each module with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes (minikube), and deploy on Minikube
to demonstrate a scalable, modular deployment structure.
Requirements:
1. Architecture:

o Design a microservices architecture with separate services for each module:
▪ Frontend Service: A responsive, user-friendly UI for user interactions.
▪ Backend Service: An API-driven backend for handling user requests,
authentication, and communication with the database.
▪ Database Service: Store user data and authentication details.
▪ Authentication Service: Manage user authentication functionalities
(Login, Signup, and Forgot Password).

2. User Authentication Module:
o Implement secure user authentication:
▪ Signup: Allow users to register.
▪ Login: Enable users to log in.
▪ Forgot Password: Provide password reset functionality.

3. Technology Stack:
o Frontend: Use a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
o Backend: Use a backend framework, such as Node.js (Express), Flask, or
Django.
o Database: Choose a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database
(e.g., MongoDB).
o Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based
authentication.
4. Containerization (Docker):
o Create individual Dockerfiles for each service (Frontend, Backend, Database,
Authentication).

o Use Docker Compose to define and run a multi-container Docker application.
o Ensure that each service is independently accessible through Docker Compose.
5. Orchestration and Deployment with Kubernetes:
o Deploy the Dockerized application on Minikube:
▪ Define Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML files for each
microservice.
▪ Use Pods to manage individual services and ensure they communicate
effectively.
▪ Expose the frontend service externally, allowing it to be accessible
through a NodePort or LoadBalancer on Minikube.
▪ Try to maintain 3 replics for each pod.

6. Documentation:
o Architecture Diagram: Visualize the microservices architecture.
o Deployment Process: Document each step of the deployment process,
including Docker Compose and Kubernetes configurations.
o Access Instructions: Explain how to access each service after deployment.

Deliverables:
1. Codebase: Provide the full code for frontend, backend, and database services.
2. Docker and Kubernetes Configurations:
o Docker Compose file.
o Dockerfiles for each service.
o Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files.
3. Deployment Demo: Record a short video demonstrating the deployment and
functionality of each service on Kubernetes with Minikube.
